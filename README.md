# BattleShip

This is the Programing Homework Assignment 1 submission for Networks class at MSU by Brooks Palin, Jonah Gilbertson, and Anthony Cordero.

This project is a node.js server that serves a game of Battleship using vue and socket.io. To run the application, you must have node.js runtime downloaded. Running the application goes as follows:

- Clone or download the project to any directory.
- Change Directories to the project head directory.
- run these 2 commands in that main directory:
```
npm install
node index.js <PORT NUMBER>
``` 
This will start the server. PORT NUMBER can be any valid port number.

To play the game after ther server is on, you must connect to the localhost:PORT NUMBER using any browser. However any browser works, **Chrome works best**.  Once 2 players are matched, they can play a game of Battleship!
